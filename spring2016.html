  <p>thanks for being the best semester yet, spring 2016 
<br>

i randomly decided to walk to the public garden this wonderfully crisp morning & had the chance to really reflect on this semester in semi-solitude, just God & myself. all throughout the semester, i’ve known that it was coming along nicely, but now that i see every aspect of it, it’s so evident that God tactfully placed every random decision i made, every occurrence that happened, every person i met / grew deeper with to create such a fulfilling semester for me, among other things. 
<br>
<br>
i had originally intended to co-op this semester, but halfway through fall, decided not to out of complacency and laziness. it was a huge regret at the start of spring, but that regret unfolded to become the best semester of college i’ve had yet. as i registered for courses, i scheduled four back to back classes on mondays but on the first day of school, already didn’t want to go to the last one. i dropped it an hour before, then added the only class that i needed/had space/fit in my schedule instead — one of the more difficult CS classes, but ended up being taught by my now-favorite professor, who substantially changed my views on (how to approach life lol.. and) what things i could pursue in the future. 
<br>
<br>
with friends, it’s a lot easier to be thankful to God for putting them in my life or whatever, but the events in which i became closer to a particular group of friends was just so random & strange — spontaneously going to get cheesecake, watching hsm until 5 am, eating tamales at the library, and everything else that happened afterwards to cultivate the camaraderie we have now :-) not to mention the lengths that my friends from california go to continue our friendships, like still keeping each other accountable for qt (although i failed, oops) and flying all the way here to visit. and i can’t forget about my family group, who i was so terrified to lead first semester but the open & loving (LOL) dynamic of this group of brothers & sisters ended up leading me. thankful to all that have made me not embrace my introversion, but instead desire community :-)
<br>
<br>
this isn’t to say there weren’t hardships or anything. there were a lot of times i was stressed, confused, bitter at God for the things that were happening, but what’s life without them? a lot of those are more personal so i won’t go into detail here, but i see His purpose in them all the same. 
anyway … kinda bittersweet that the semester is over but man am I glad I never have to touch theory of computation (aka the only class i tried in) again. and excited to see what God has in store for summer + rest of college + rest of life woooot

this was initially going to be an instagram caption on a selfie i took at the public garden but idk if i can taint my feed with a selfie LOL so it’ll live here, i guess
