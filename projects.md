## Magic 8 Ball
I (once) started packing & realized I had way too much stuff, plus got bored of packing, so I made a magic 8 ball to help me figure out what to bring home and what to throw away. Two years later, I re-found this little utility originally written in Java and decided to try & whip up a UI for it. Rewrote the utility in JavaScript, and started making a basic front end in HTML/CSS :-) (I hope to work on it more even though there are a lot of Magic 8 Balls out there!)
