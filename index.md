# Hi!

I'm currently a PhD student at [the University of Chicago](https://www.uchicago.edu/) advised by [Blase Ur](https://www.blaseur.com/).   

Prior to that, I was a software engineer at [Block](https://block.xyz/). I worked on [Cash App's](https://cash.app/) marketing engineering team and [Square's](https://squareup.com/us/en) user authentication team.  

I did my undergrad at [Northeastern University](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/) and got my BS in computer science. During that time, I did some research focusing on mobile privacy (specifically, media exfiltration from apps) and interned at a couple of swell startups.  

In my free time, I like shooting film photography, backpacking, and hanging out with my dog. Usually all together!
