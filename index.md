# Hi!

I'm currently a software engineer at [Square](https://squareup.com/) working on the (user) auth team in Atlanta. Previously, I was an undergrad at Northeastern University and got my BS in computer science. During that time, I did some research focusing on mobile privacy (specifically, media exfiltration from apps) and interned at a couple of swell startups. üë©üèª‚Äçüíª
