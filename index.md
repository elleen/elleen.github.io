# Hi!

I'm Elleen. I'm an engineer @ [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/).

In a past life, I:
* was an unsuccessful PhD student at [UChicago](https://www.uchicago.edu/) 
* worked at [Block](https://block.xyz/) on [Cash App's](https://cash.app/) marketing engineering team and [Square's](https://squareup.com/us/en) user authentication team
* did my BS in computer science at [Northeastern University](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/) and did some fun research on mobile app privacy ([press](/press))
* interned at some swell startups, like [Placester](https://placester.com/) and [Hudl](https://www.hudl.com/)

In my free time, I like spending time outdoors (backpacking, cycling, snowboarding, taking a stroll on a nice Chicago summer day) and hanging out with my dog, Bean.
