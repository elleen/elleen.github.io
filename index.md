# hi!

I'm a recent graduate of Northeastern University, where I received my BS in Computer Science. I'm excited to be joining [Square](https://squareup.com/) as a software engineer later this summer.  

In my free time, I like riding my bike, trying new food, and taking care of my plants 🌱

📍 currently Boston ☃️ , soon Atlanta 🍑
