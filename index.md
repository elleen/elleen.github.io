# Hi!

I'm currently a software engineer at [Square](https://squareup.com/) working on the (user) auth team in Atlanta. Previously, I was an undergrad at Northeastern University and got my BS in computer science. During that time, I did some research focusing on mobile privacy (specifically, media exfiltration from apps) and interned at a couple of swell startups. More resume-y things [here](/resume) 👩🏻‍💻

When I'm not in front of a screen, I spend my time cycling, exploring (mostly food in) ATL, hanging out with my [dog](/bean), taking care of my plants, and sleeping.
