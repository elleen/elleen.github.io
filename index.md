# Hi!

I'm currently a software engineer at [Block](https://block.xyz/). I currently work on [Cash App's](https://cash.app/) marketing engineering team, and have also worked on [Square's](https://squareup.com/us/en) (user) authentication team.

Before all that, I did my undergrad at Northeastern University and got my BS in computer science. During that time, I did some research focusing on mobile privacy (specifically, media exfiltration from apps) and interned at a couple of swell startups.
