# Hi!

I'm Elleen. I'm an engineer @ [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/).

In my past lives, I have been:
* an unsuccessful PhD student at [UChicago](https://www.uchicago.edu/) ([pubs](/publications))
* a software engineer at [Block](https://block.xyz/), working on marketing engineering at [Cash App](https://cash.app/) and user authentication at [Square](https://squareup.com/us/en) 
* an undergrad at [Northeastern](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/), where I got my BS in computer science and did research on [mobile app privacy](/files/pan-panoptispy-2018.pdf) ([press](/press))
* an intern at [Placester](https://placester.com/) and [Hudl](https://www.hudl.com/)

In my free time, I like spending time outdoors (backpacking, cycling, snowboarding, taking a stroll on a nice Chicago summer day) and hanging out with my dog, Bean.
