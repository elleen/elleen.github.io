# Hi!

I'm Elleen. I'm an engineer @ [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/).

In a past life, I:
* was an unsuccessful PhD student at [UChicago](https://www.uchicago.edu/) 
* was a software engineer at [Block](https://block.xyz/), working on marketing engineering at [Cash App](https://cash.app/) and user authentication at [Square](https://squareup.com/us/en) 
* did my BS in computer science at [Northeastern](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/) and did some fun research on mobile app privacy ([press](/press))
* interned at some swell startups, like [Placester](https://placester.com/) and [Hudl](https://www.hudl.com/)

In my free time, I like spending time outdoors (backpacking, cycling, snowboarding, taking a stroll on a nice Chicago summer day) and hanging out with my dog, Bean.
